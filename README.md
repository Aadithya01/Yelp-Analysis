# Yelp-Analysis
Analyzed the Yelp dataset to understand driving factors of business 

# Motivation
Yelp very recently refreshed its board of directors and is currently transforming its business model from CPM to CPC. (impression-based internet advertising to cost-per-click performance-based model) With the new management team onboard, Yelp is now committed to mid-teen CAGRs(Compound Annual Growth Rate) from 2019 - 2023. In Yelp’s most recent earnings presentations, they state that revenues from subscription software and new partnerships are growing at 30%. However, these account for only 5% of Yelp’s total business. This means that for the short term, Yelp will drive its growth rate by pushing its sales team to growth their advertising accounts in a consistent way, while at the same time cutting operating budgets aggressively. We anticipate that the following 1-2 years will be a painful period for Yelp’s current sales representatives. We hope our model can help Yelp’s sales representatives in the following ways:

1. Filter out dying local businesses so they don’t have to call everyone on their cold call number lists

2. Utilize the time they free up to building relationships and improve client retention & explore multi-location and national accounts

3. Decide whether to onboard a business on its platform looking at its attributes and predicting if they’ll survive or not
